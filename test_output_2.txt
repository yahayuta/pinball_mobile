00:00 +0: MissionManager Mission starts and completes correctly
00:00 +0 -1: MissionManager Mission starts and completes correctly [E]
  Bad state: A test tried to use `any` or `captureAny` on a parameter of type `Vector2`, but
  registerFallbackValue was not previously called to register a fallback value for `Vector2`.
  
  To fix, do:
  
  ```
  void main() {
    setUpAll(() {
      registerFallbackValue(/* create a dummy instance of `Vector2` */);
    });
  }
  ```
  
  This instance of `Vector2` will only be passed around, but never be interacted with.
  Therefore, if `Vector2` is a function, it does not have to return a valid object and
  could throw unconditionally.
  If you cannot easily create an instance of `Vector2`, consider defining a `Fake`:
  
  ```
  class MyTypeFake extends Fake implements MyType {}
  
  void main() {
    setUpAll(() {
      registerFallbackValue(MyTypeFake());
    });
  }
  ```
  
  Fallbacks are required because mocktail has to know of a valid `Vector2` to prevent
  TypeErrors from being thrown in Dart's sound null safe mode, while still
  providing a convenient syntax.

  Invalid argument(s): An argument matcher (like `any()`) was either not used as an immediate argument to Symbol("audioManager") (argument matchers can only be used as an argument for the very method being stubbed or verified), or was used as a named argument without the Mocktail "named" API (Each argument matcher that is used as a named argument needs to specify the name of the argument it is being used in. For example: `when(() => obj.fn(x: any(named: "x")))`).
